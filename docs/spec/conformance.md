# Conformance Profiles

ACS v0.1.0 conformance is tiered. Every conformant deployment implements **ACS-Core** — the mandatory baseline below. Trace event emission, AgBOM serialization, field-level provenance, cryptographic signatures, and strengthened audit chains are organized as **profiles** that deployments declare independently in the [handshake](./instrument/specification.md#4-capability-negotiation-handshake).

The profile system lets a small harness ship a useful subset of ACS quickly, while a more capable deployment can layer on observability, supply-chain inventory, or cryptographic integrity without changing the wire format.

## Profile declaration

Profiles are declared in the handshake. ClientHello includes `profiles_supported: string[]`; ServerHello includes `profiles_accepted: string[]`. Profile names are the lowercase hyphenated forms below: `acs-core`, `acs-trace`, `acs-inspect`, `acs-inspect-dynamic`, `acs-provenance`, `acs-crypto`, `acs-audit`.

A Guardian MAY refuse a session if the client does not declare a profile the Guardian's policy requires (e.g. a Guardian whose policy needs provenance MAY refuse a client that does not declare `acs-provenance`).

## ACS-Core (mandatory baseline)

A v0.1.0-conformant deployment MUST implement ACS-Core. ACS-Core comprises:

- **Handshake** — `handshake/hello` with ClientHello/ServerHello ([Specification §4](./instrument/specification.md#4-capability-negotiation-handshake)).
- **Request/response envelope** — JSON-RPC 2.0 with ACS extensions ([§3](./instrument/specification.md#3-wire-format)). `request_id`, `timestamp`, `acs_version`, `metadata` required on every request.
- **Hook taxonomy** — At minimum: `sessionStart`, `userMessage` or `agentTrigger`, `toolCallRequest`, `toolCallResult`, `agentResponse`, `sessionEnd`, `subagentStart`. A subagent-capable client MUST emit `subagentStart` when it spawns a sub-agent; a client whose framework has no sub-agent abstraction has nothing to emit. The Guardian determines client subagent-emission capability by deployment-defined means (agent identity bound at handshake, policy keyed on `agent_id`, organizational configuration), mirroring the ASK precedent in [§9.2](./instrument/specification.md#92-approver-incapable-clients-normative). Without `subagentStart`, a Guardian is blind to cross-agent propagation (the confused-deputy attack class). `subagentStop` is SHOULD-emit (audit-only, not decision-eligible; its `final_chain_hash` field is optional for frameworks maintaining no session-chain — see [`subagent-stop.json`](https://github.com/afogel/ACS_official/blob/dev/specification/v0.1.0/hooks/subagent-stop.json)). Additional hooks (`turnStart`/`turnEnd`, `preCompact`/`postCompact`, `knowledgeRetrieval`, `memoryContextRetrieval`, `memoryStore`, `skillRegister`/`skillLoad`/`skillUnload`) are normatively defined and SHOULD be implemented when the harness can observe the corresponding event; they are capability-negotiated via the handshake. A deployment whose AgBOM includes `skill` components SHOULD emit the skill lifecycle hooks, so a Guardian is not blind to a composition surface the inventory already exposes.
- **Dispositions** — Four MUST-support: ALLOW, DENY, ASK, DEFER, with required fields per [§6](./instrument/specification.md#6-disposition-vocabulary). MODIFY is SHOULD-support: deployments that implement MODIFY MUST follow the MODIFY composition rules ([§6.3](./instrument/specification.md#63-modify-composition-normative)); deployments that do not implement MODIFY are handled per [§6.5](./instrument/specification.md#65-modify-incapable-clients-normative) (the Guardian substitutes `DENY` with `reason_codes: ["modify_unsupported"]` and an audit event recording the substitution, determined by deployment-defined means rather than a wire declaration, mirroring the §9.2 precedent for ASK).
- **SessionContext and Intent**: `session_id`, `chain_hash` (rolling SHA-256), append-only ContextEntry chain, with the Guardian publishing the chain head (`chain_hash`) on responses for content-bearing steps ([§8](./instrument/specification.md#8-sessioncontext-and-intent)). Intent is optional but normative when IBAC is the enforcement paradigm.
- **Replay protection** — `request_id` (UUID) and `timestamp` on every request; Guardians MUST reject replays per [§10.3](./instrument/specification.md#103-replay-protection).
- **Baseline integrity**: every request and response carries a signature over the canonical envelope ([§10](./instrument/specification.md#10-cryptographic-signatures)). `HMAC-SHA256` with an HKDF-derived per-session key from deployment-provided key material is the baseline; asymmetric and post-quantum algorithms are the ACS-Crypto profile.
- **Decision honoring**: the Observed Agent MUST wait for the Guardian's decision up to the negotiated timeout and apply it; on a decision failure (timeout, transport failure, or an error without a decision) it applies the `on_decision_failure` posture (default `proceed`, fail-open) and records every fail-open proceed as an audit event ([§6.4](./instrument/specification.md#64-honoring-decisions-normative)). Handshake failure follows the deployment's startup posture ([§4.1](./instrument/specification.md#41-handshake-failure-normative)).
- **Liveness** — `system/ping` ([§13](./instrument/specification.md#13-liveness-system-methods)) SHOULD be implemented. A deployment MAY omit `system/ping` only if it has declared an alternative liveness mechanism in its configuration (for example: TCP keepalive or HTTP/2 PING on HTTP transports; process supervision or an out-of-band heartbeat on stdio; or continuous observed hook traffic where the session's own cadence acts as the probe). Omitting `system/ping` without a declared alternative is non-conformant: the chain of defaults (`startup_posture: proceed`, `on_decision_failure: proceed`, no liveness) produces silent fail-open on Guardian outage, which the Core baseline cannot allow.
- **Wrapped MCP** — `protocols/MCP/*` ([Hooks](./instrument/hooks.md#protocolsmcp)) MUST be implemented by deployments whose sessions involve MCP at any point (tools, resources, prompts, notifications), so that `protocols/MCP/resources/read` — the canonical prompt-injection ingress for attacker-controlled external content — is not bypassed. Support is declared in the handshake via `wrapped_protocols`. Deployments that declared no MCP at handshake MUST NOT spawn or register MCP servers mid-session; renegotiation is undefined in v0.1, so mid-session MCP addition is non-conformant until v0.2 ships it. Deployments whose sessions never involve MCP MAY omit the namespace.

ACS-Core does NOT require: field-level Provenance objects, Trace event emission, AgBOM, asymmetric or post-quantum signatures, or `request_hash` on ContextEntry (`request_hash` remains SHOULD). It DOES require the baseline signature (§10) and decision honoring (§6.4). ACS-Core deployments validate hook payloads against the base schemas, where `provenance` is OPTIONAL; field-level Provenance is added by the ACS-Provenance profile.

What "ACS-Core conformant" guarantees: the channel is authenticated and the Observed Agent honors the Guardian's decisions on the four MUST-support dispositions (ALLOW, DENY, ASK, DEFER). Deployments that also implement MODIFY (SHOULD-support, [§6.5](./instrument/specification.md#65-modify-incapable-clients-normative)) honor it too; deployments that do not receive `DENY` substitutions with `reason_code: modify_unsupported`. A minimum-conformant deployment can therefore permit or refuse an action but cannot alter it — redaction and other content rewrites require MODIFY support. This clause does NOT assert that a deployment's policies are strict, nor that the audit chain is tamper-evident against a compromised Guardian (that is the ACS-Crypto and ACS-Audit profiles, since the HMAC baseline is symmetric). A permissive Guardian is a conformant but permissive deployment, not a violation.

## ACS-Trace

Adds deterministic Trace event emission per [Trace Events](./trace/events.md). A deployment claiming ACS-Trace MUST:

1. Emit at least one of {OTel, OCSF} for every supported ACS step, with the required attributes populated.
2. Record decisions as Trace events.
3. Carry provenance facts forward onto Trace events.

Required for deployments that need cross-vendor observability or SIEM integration. Trace events MUST NOT block enforcement.

## ACS-Inspect

Adds AgBOM snapshot emission per [Inspect](./inspect/README.md). A deployment claiming ACS-Inspect MUST:

1. Emit `agbom/snapshot` once per session before content-bearing hooks fire.
2. Have the Guardian serialize the canonical AgBOM into at least one of {CycloneDX 1.6, SPDX 3.0, SWID} on request.

Required when Guardian policy depends on component inventory.

### ACS-Inspect-Dynamic (extends ACS-Inspect)

Adds `agbom/changed` emission on every mid-session component mutation, with audit-chain integration. Required for deployments where agents hot-swap models, tools, or MCP servers.

## ACS-Provenance

Adds field-level Provenance objects ([§7](./instrument/specification.md#7-provenance)) to data-bearing fields. A deployment claiming ACS-Provenance runs `provenance_producer: deterministic` and MUST attach a Provenance object to every data-bearing field in every hook payload it emits, populating `provenance_id`, `origin`, and (when applicable) `derived_from`. Payloads are validated against the strict `*.acs-provenance.json` variant of each data-bearing hook, which restores `provenance` to the required set; ACS-Core deployments validate against the permissive base schema. Partial population within a producing session is non-conformant.

The wire-format `trust` enum is OPTIONAL in v0.1; the v0.1 expected practice is for Guardians to derive trust from `origin` + `source_id` against local policy without populating the field. Vendor Guardian implementations that elect to populate `trust` on the wire MUST enforce the monotonicity rule on `agent_generated` trust and SHOULD use the default channel-to-trust mapping ([§7.2](./instrument/specification.md#72-default-channel-to-trust-mapping)) so cross-deployment audits remain portable.

Required for FIDES, CaMeL, and AARM-style enforcement paradigms (which depend on the trust *concept* — whether materialized on the wire or derived in policy). Not required for pure IBAC.

## ACS-Crypto

Adds cryptographic signature support beyond the baseline's replay-protection fields. A deployment claiming ACS-Crypto MUST support at least `ML-DSA-65` (RECOMMENDED primary) and SHOULD support `SLH-DSA-128s` as an algorithmic-diversity backup. Hybrid composites (`ML-DSA-65+ECDSA-P256`, `ML-DSA-65+RSA-PSS-SHA256`) are OPTIONAL for transitional deployments.

ACS-Core requires a baseline signature; `HMAC-SHA256` over the canonical envelope ([§10](./instrument/specification.md#10-cryptographic-signatures)) satisfies it. ACS-Crypto replaces or augments the baseline with asymmetric and post-quantum algorithms, which add the non-repudiation and external verifiability the symmetric baseline cannot give. Transport-level security alone does not satisfy the Core signature requirement: it does not bind a message for audit, or across multi-hop A2A and multi-Guardian paths.

Policy-author identity is distinct from both Observed Agent identity and Guardian identity. v0.1 keeps policy-author authorization and trust schemes deployment-defined, but `policy_references[].policy_version` gives replay and ledger-backed deployments a stable pointer to the policy state that was evaluated. A future Policy Attestation profile is expected to bind policy references to verifiable author signatures using algorithms from the ACS-Crypto registry while leaving the deployment trust scheme (for example SPIFFE, OIDC, DID, organizational PKI, or quorum signing) out of the core wire contract.

## ACS-Audit

Strengthens the audit chain beyond ACS-Core's baseline. A deployment claiming ACS-Audit MUST populate `request_hash` (lowercase-hex SHA-256 of JCS-canonicalized request params) on every ContextEntry, ensuring the chain commits to request content, not just step metadata. ACS-Audit deployments SHOULD also populate `timestamp` and `provenance_summary` on every ContextEntry.

## Profile combinations

Profiles compose. A deployment that wants full observability and supply-chain inventory but not asymmetric or post-quantum signatures (it keeps the Core HMAC baseline) declares `["acs-core", "acs-trace", "acs-inspect", "acs-provenance"]`. A high-assurance deployment declares all of `["acs-core", "acs-trace", "acs-inspect", "acs-inspect-dynamic", "acs-provenance", "acs-crypto", "acs-audit"]`. A minimal IDE harness declares `["acs-core"]` only.
