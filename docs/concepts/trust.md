# Trust basis

Every fact ACS carries has a *trust basis*: the grounds on which a Guardian may rely on it. ACS never assumes a wire fact is true. It makes the basis explicit, so policy can require a minimum.

Trust basis is a property of every fact, not a field on the wire. ACS carries no single `trust` value. Instead, *how a fact was produced* determines how far up the spectrum it sits.

## The spectrum

Trust basis runs from asserted to attested. Each rung is a stronger ground for reliance than the one before.

### Asserted

The emitter says so; reliance equals reliance on the emitter. Unsigned Trace events, tool outputs, `agent_generated` content, and Intent before any signature are asserted facts. The Guardian must decide independently whether to trust them. This is the default for anything on the wire that nothing stronger backs.

### Deterministically attached

Framework code, not the LLM, attaches the fact from a structural property of how the data moved. Two cases qualify: a [Provenance](./provenance.md) record's `origin`, `source_id`, and `derived_from`, assigned by the framework under `provenance_producer: deterministic`; and the AgBOM `registration_provenance` (framework-declared versus runtime-discovered). The model cannot influence either, which makes them stronger than assertions. They are only as trustworthy as the framework that attaches them.

### Cryptographically attested

The fact is bound by a signature or a hash chain and is verifiable without trusting the emitter at evaluation time. Signed envelopes (ACS-Crypto), the SessionContext audit chain via `previous_hash` and `request_hash` (ACS-Audit), and the future Policy Attestation profile are attested. An attested fact survives a compromised or replayed emitter.

## Invariants

> **The rungs do not collapse (normative).** A Guardian MUST NOT treat an asserted fact as attested. The basis of a fact is part of the fact; relying on a fact above its actual basis is an error.

> **Deterministic attachment is not a producer claim (normative).** Where ACS specifies a deterministically attached fact (a Provenance record's `origin` is the canonical case), the framework assigns it from the code path the value came through, never the producer of the data and never the LLM. Such a fact is never a content judgment and never a producer claim.

## The basis must travel

When a fact is summarized, written to memory, or passed across a boundary, its trust basis must travel with it. A derivation of asserted content is asserted; it does not become attested by being restated. This is the same rule that makes [Provenance](./provenance.md) lineage transitive, viewed from the trust side: dropping the basis at a boundary lets asserted content be treated as if it were attested, trust laundering up the spectrum.

*Example.* An agent reads an untrusted email (asserted) and writes a summary to memory. If the summary keeps the email's basis, a second agent that retrieves it still treats it as asserted. If the basis is dropped, the memory reads like trusted recall.

## Availability in v0.1

The spectrum is the design frame; conformance profiles declare which rungs a deployment actually provides.

| Rung | v0.1 status |
|---|---|
| Asserted | Always; the default. |
| Deterministically attached | Available; Provenance `origin`/`source_id`/`derived_from` are framework-assigned under `provenance_producer: deterministic`, required under **ACS-Provenance** (with `registration_provenance` on components). |
| Cryptographically attested | Profile-gated: **ACS-Crypto** (signatures), **ACS-Audit** (`request_hash` chain), and partly future (Policy Attestation, v0.2). |

A deployment is conformant without the top rung. The point of naming the spectrum is that policy can *require* a rung where the stakes justify it, and the Guardian can tell which rung a given fact actually has.
