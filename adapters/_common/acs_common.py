"""
Shared ACS v0.1.0 helpers used by the three reference adapters and the
example Guardian.

Lives in `adapters/_common/`. Each adapter prepends this directory to
`sys.path` and imports the symbols it needs.

What's in here:

- `jcs_canonicalize` — RFC 8785 (JCS) canonicalization via the
  `rfc8785` PyPI package. A hard dependency: spec §10 permits no
  alternative canonicalization, so there is deliberately no fallback
  (a near-JCS fallback diverges on floats and turns into a silent
  fail-open at the adapter — PR #22 review).
- `derive_session_key` — HKDF-SHA256 per-session key derivation per §10.
- `sign_envelope` / `verify_signature` — HMAC-SHA256 baseline signature
  over JCS(envelope with signature field removed), per §10.
- `load_hmac_secret` — read the HMAC secret from `ACS_HMAC_SECRET_FILE`
  (preferred: file mode 0600) or `ACS_HMAC_SECRET` (env). File path
  beats env var so secrets don't sit in `ps aux` output.
- `iso8601_now` / `coerce_uuid` / `parse_iso8601` — time + ID helpers.
- `audit_event` — structured `ACS_AUDIT` line for §6.4 fail-open bypass.
- `ensure_session_handshake` / `ping` — protocol helpers (§4, §13).
  `ensure_session_handshake` is idempotent per session via disk cache;
  see its docstring. The old name `do_handshake` is kept as an alias.
- `session_state` — per-session JSON file used by adapters to track
  last_step_id, seen_step_ids, etc. across separate hook-process
  invocations (shell-stdin adapters spawn one process per hook).

    Spec contract (§4): handshake is REQUIRED at session start, ONCE

    persist the negotiated ServerHello in a small JSON file under
    `~/.cache/acs-adapter-handshake/<sha256(session_id+url)>.json`:

      - First event of a session: cache miss → POSTs ClientHello,
        receives ServerHello, writes cache file, returns ServerHello.
      - Subsequent events same session: cache hit (file fresh, < 1h
        old by default) → reads file, returns cached ServerHello.
        NO network call.
      - Cache files older than the TTL are ignored so operator
        Guardian-config changes propagate.

    Returns the ServerHello (cached or freshly fetched), or None on
    failure (Guardian unreachable, etc.) — adapters fall to their
    startup posture in that case (§4.1).

    Function-name rationale: previously `do_handshake`, which
    misleadingly read as 'POST every call'. The cache short-circuit
    makes this an ensure-once, so the name says so.

    Hardening (PR #22 review):
      - The ServerHello response envelope's signature is verified before
        it is cached or returned; an unverifiable ServerHello is a
        failure, not a Guardian.
      - The WHOLE signed response envelope is cached (not the bare
        payload) and re-verified on every cache read — the cache file
        sits at a predictable path writable by the observed agent, so an
        unverified read would let the agent flip its own fail posture by
        editing one word.
      - The response is bound to the ClientHello by JSON-RPC id.
      - Failures are negative-cached for a short TTL so a dead Guardian
        costs one timeout, not one per hook event; every negative-cache
        hit is audited (§4.1:77 — an unguarded session must be recorded).
