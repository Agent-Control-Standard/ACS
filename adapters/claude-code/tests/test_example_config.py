"""
The drop-in settings.json.example — the file people copy — must itself
cover the Core-minimum hook set, with gate hooks fail-closed.

Emission proves the adapter CAN emit each hook when invoked; this puts
the checked-in EXAMPLE config under test, closing the "file people copy
isn't in the loop" gap that first shipped as Claude's 5-of-6 (PR #22
emission re-review).

Assertions read the COMMAND STRING, not a per-hook `env` object:
Claude Code's command-hook fields are command, args, async, asyncRewake,
shell plus the common ones — there is no `env`, so anything there is
silently dropped and the hook runs with Claude Code's own environment
(PR #22 review: the previous example passed every setting through that
dropped field, and the previous version of this test asserted the same
dropped field, certifying a config that governed nothing).
