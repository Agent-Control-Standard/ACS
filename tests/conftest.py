"""Shared guards that keep the published site from contacting a third party.

The guard has been found incomplete five times. Every earlier version enumerated the
attributes that fetch, and each new construct was a fresh gap: a poster attribute, an
unquoted value, a stylesheet, a base element, an inline script body. So this one
enumerates the positions that do not fetch instead. Anything else carrying an absolute
URL counts as a fetch, which makes an unanticipated construct a failure rather than a
silent pass.
